### Day 4 - January 4 (Value)

**Educational Thread:**
```
The real cost of slow typing:

At 40 WPM vs 80 WPM, you spend 2x longer on every:
- ChatGPT prompt
- Slack message
- Email draft
- Code comment

Over a year? That's 100+ hours lost.

Touch typing isn't optional in 2026. It's a productivity multiplier.
