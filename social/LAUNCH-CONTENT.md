### Maker's First Comment (Critical - 70% of top products have this)

```
Hey Product Hunt!

I built TypeBit8 because every typing tutor I tried was painfully boring. As someone who uses AI tools constantly (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot), I realized my typing speed was actually my bottleneck.

The math is simple:
- 40 WPM = 2,400 words/hour
- 80 WPM = 4,800 words/hour

That's literally 2x productivity for anyone working with AI.

So I built the typing trainer I wished existed:
- Pixel-art aesthetic (nostalgia hit)
- 50 levels with themed content (AI prompts, code, business)
- Actual gamification - not just badges, real progression

It's free to play. Premium unlocks advanced levels and 2x coins.

Would love your feedback - especially on:
1. What WPM did you get on your first test?
2. Any level themes you'd want to see?

Thanks for checking it out!
```
