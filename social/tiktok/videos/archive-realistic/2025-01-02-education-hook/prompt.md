# Day 2 Education Hook Video

## Prompt Used
```
Vertical 9:16 TikTok format educational video. A young professional sitting at a desk looking frustrated, typing slowly with two fingers while looking down at keyboard. Text overlay appears: "Why you're STILL typing slow in 2025". Camera zooms to show incorrect hand position - index fingers hunting for keys, other fingers not touching keyboard. Then transition to same person now with proper touch typing form: all 10 fingers resting on home row ASDF JKL keys, wrists elevated, fingers curved naturally. Text overlay: "The fix takes 2 weeks". Fast smooth typing motion without looking at keyboard. Dark room with cyan and yellow RGB keyboard backlighting, retro gaming monitors in background. Cinematic lighting, satisfying transformation.
