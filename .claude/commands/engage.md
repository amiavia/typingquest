# X.com Engagement Workflow

Find 3-5 relevant posts on X.com and draft witty, value-add replies that subtly promote the project.

**Project:** typebit8 (touch typing practice app)
**X Account:** @typebit8

## Search Queries (pick 1-2 based on project)
- "typing speed" OR "touch typing"
- "learn to code" beginners
- "productivity tips" developers
- "mechanical keyboard" typing
- "WPM" words per minute

## Steps

1. **Open X.com** in Chrome using browser tools (get tab context first)

2. **VERIFY/SWITCH ACCOUNT** (CRITICAL - DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE):
   - Look at the account indicator in the left sidebar (shows current @username)
   - If the account matches the target account: proceed to step 3
   - If the account is WRONG:
     a. Click on the account menu (bottom left, shows profile picture and @username)
     b. Look for the target account in the account switcher menu
     c. Click to switch to the correct account
     d. Wait for switch to complete, verify the correct account is now shown
   - If unable to switch (target account not in switcher):
     STOP IMMEDIATELY and report:
     "Cannot switch to [target account]. Please log into the correct account manually and re-run."
   - NEVER proceed to search or post without confirming the correct account is active

3. **Search for posts** using relevant queries above

4. **Evaluate each post**:
   - Recent (last 24h preferred)?
   - Has engagement potential?
   - Natural angle for the project?

5. **Draft 3-5 replies** that are:
   - Witty and conversational (not salesy)
   - Add value first (tip, insight, empathy)
   - Mention project only if natural
   - Match original post's tone
   - NEVER use em dashes, only regular hyphens

6. **Show drafts** to user for approval before posting

## Reply Style Examples

**Typing speed discussions:**
"[Insight]. I went from X to Y WPM with deliberate practice. The gamified approach actually made it stick"

**Productivity posts:**
"Underrated hack: typing faster. Sounds basic but it compounds - more time thinking, less time hunting keys"

**Developer posts:**
"Also wild how much faster you ship when you're not looking at the keyboard. Touch typing is the cheat code"

## Rules
- Max 3-5 posts per day
- Space out replies
- Never hard-sell or spam links
- Get user approval before posting
- Use regular hyphens (-) not em dashes
